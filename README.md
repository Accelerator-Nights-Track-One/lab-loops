# JavaScript Looping Drills

## Overview
You'll practice working with `for` loops, `while` loops, and control the flow of execution to repeat certain actions multiple times.

### Instructions:
In **loops.js** for each prompt, write a JavaScript program that solves the problem using the appropriate type of loop. Make sure to run the program in your terminal to check if it works as expected.

## For Loops

1. **Count to Ten**  
   Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.

2. **Even Numbers Only**  
   Write a program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 20.

3. **Reverse Counting**  
   Write a program that prints numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.

4. **Sum of Numbers**  
   Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50.

5. **Multiples of 3**  
   Write a program that prints all multiples of 3 from 1 to 30.

6. **Print Squares**  
   Write a program that prints the square of each number from 1 to 5.

7. **Factorial Calculation**  
   Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a `for` loop.

8. **Print Numbers Divisible by 5**  
   Write a program that prints all numbers between 1 and 20 that are divisible by 5.

9. **Print Odd Numbers**  
   Write a program that prints all odd numbers between 1 and 20.

10. **Print Numbers Divisible by 4**  
    Write a program that prints all numbers between 1 and 20 that are divisible by 4.

11. **Exponential Growth**  
    Write a program that prints the result of raising 2 to the power of each number from 1 to 5 (i.e., 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, etc.).

12. **Sum of Even Numbers**  
    Write a program that sums all even numbers from 1 to 100 and prints the result.

13. **Reverse Word Print**  
    Write a program that prints a string in reverse using a `for` loop (without using built-in reverse methods).

14. **Number Pyramid**  
    Write a program that prints a pyramid pattern using numbers (e.g., 1, 22, 333, 4444, etc.).

15. **Prime Number Checker**  
    Write a program that checks if a number is prime by using a `for` loop and prints ‚ÄúPrime‚Äù or ‚ÄúNot Prime‚Äù.

### While Loops

16. **While Counting**  
    Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 5 using a `while` loop.

17. **Infinite Loop**  
    Write a program that runs an infinite `while` loop until a specific condition is met (e.g., user input or a counter reaches a certain number).

18. **Countdown with While Loop**  
    Write a program that counts down from 5 to 1 using a `while` loop.

19. **Sum of Odd Numbers**  
    Write a program that sums all odd numbers from 1 to 50 using a `while` loop and prints the result.

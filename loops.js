// Complete these drills using For Loops & While Loops

// Example prompt: Write a program that calculates the sum of the numbers from 1 to 5 using a loop. 
// Print the sum after the loop finishes running.
// let sum = 0;
// for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
//     sum += i;
// }
// console.log("The sum is:", sum);


////////// For Loops /////////

// 1. Count to Ten: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

// 2. Even Numbers Only: Write a program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 20.

// 15. Prime Number Checker: Write a program that checks if a number is prime by using a for loop and prints “Prime” or “Not Prime”.

/////////// While Loops /////////

// 16. While Counting: Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop.

// 17. Infinite Loop: Write a program that runs an infinite while loop until a specific condition is met (e.g., user input or a counter reaches a certain number).

// 18. Countdown with While Loop: Write a program that counts down from 5 to 1 using a while loop.

// 19. Sum of Odd Numbers: Write a program that sums all odd numbers from 1 to 50 using a while loop and prints the result.
